# Redux - Additional Topics

## What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?

The most 'redux-like' way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount ) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app. However, you will not use the results of the API call directly in that component - it needs to be handled with a reducer that puts it into your app store. This will require you to use some sort of a thunk middleware to handle the asynchronous action. Then you will use mapStateToProps to simply pass it down to the component that renders the data.

## When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?

When the asynchronous task ends, a callback should manage the outcome of the asynchronous task and appropriately update the state with a positive or negative response, support asynchronous actions by modifying their reducers, i.e. making sure that the reducer intercepting that action starts the asynchronous task and manages its outcome

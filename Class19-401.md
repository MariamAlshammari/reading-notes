# AWS: Events

## Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server

They are both ways you can implement an API. Within an Express Server you define your routes and write the logic for them. With AWS API Gateway, you set up your routes and then implement the functionality using lamda functions.

## List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each

* AWS database offerings include:

* RDS

* DynamoDB

* Neptune

* Amazon QLDB

## Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

A FIFO queue is first in first out and a standard queue provides at least once delivery and isn't neccessarily ordered.

## How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

 Logging and using timestamps and checking whether it was delivered based on the response sent from the endpoint.

## What header(s) are used in authentication and authorization
The HTTP Authorization request header contains the credentials to authenticate a user agent with a server, usually, but not necessarily, after the server has responded with a 401 Unauthorized status and the WWW-Authenticate header.



## What is safe to put into a JWT
- Data token: As the JWT serialized form is compact and easy to integrate in HTTP request JWT are often used as a mechanism of data interchange.
- ID token: Issued by an Identity Manager, on behalf of a client application, after authenticating the user. It allows the client application to get user information from the token in a safe way without the need of managing user credentials.
- Access token: Issued by an authorization server, on behalf of a client application, it allows the client application to access a protected resource on behalf of a user. This kind of token is used as an authentication and authorization mechanism by the client application towards the server holding the resource.




## How are JWTs validated
- Use any existing middleware for your web framework.

- Choose a third-party library from JWT.io.

- Manually implement the checks described in specification RFC 7519 > 7.2 Validating a JWT.

> We strongly recommend that you use middleware or one of the existing open source third-party libraries to parse and validate JWTs. At JWT.io, you can find libraries for various platforms and languages, such as .NET, Python, Java, Ruby, Objective-C, Swift, and PHP.

| RBAC| Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network. |
| User Roles|The Professional Archive Platform contains five standard Roles. These Roles can be assigned to Users as-is, or they can be duplicated and modified to meet your organizationâ€™s specifications. Custom Roles can also be created.|
| JWT Token|JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.|

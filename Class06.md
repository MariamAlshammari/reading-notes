### is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node. js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.






## **In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**


### is a JavaScript engine. Originally, JavaScript was written to be executed by web browsers. 
### V8 translates JavaScript code directly into machine code so that computers can actually understand it, then it executes the translated, or compiled code.

## **What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

### Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.

 >so runtime in js refers to where your javascript code is executed when you run it. That said, javascript can be executed on google chrome, in which case your javascript runtime is v8, if on mozilla - it is spidermonkey, if IE - then its chakra and if on node, again its v8.

## **What is npm?**


### pm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.

## **What version of node are you running on your machine?**

### v12.22.1

## **What version of npm are you running on your machine?**
### 6.14.12

## **What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**

### I can install jshint locally with npm install jshint or globally with npm install -g jshint. If your jshint module is in a different location, use the jshint.nodePath setting to specify the correct path.

## **What is node used for?**


###  is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

# **6 Reasons for Pair Programming**



![img7](https://misikirmehari.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/pair-programming-1-728.jpg)

## **1.What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**


1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness


## **2.In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

### Learning from fellow students , bBecause everyone has a different way of thinking, and it is possible for him to have easier ways to solve some problems and to have some ideas that are easy to understand by others, and it is also possible to learn from his mistakes and not forget it.



## **3.How does pair programming work?**

### pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
